# Car-Crash-Injury-Predictor
## Used crash data from Montgomery MD to create a classifier for injury/fatality vs property damage 
Used LASSO with logistic regression to classify 1 as injury/fatality and 0 as property damage.
Cleaned the data and dropped columns which I found to be less relevant.

Overall an interesting project, however not very useful. Will come back to it once I realize how to find the statistical significance of the final coefficients used, and optimize feature selection accordingly. I May also come back to it using Random Forest however my current computer is not good enough as it takes forever to compute.

Got my data from
